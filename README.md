# Project Overview
This project encompasses a complete machine learning workflow, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, and a FastAPI application for serving predictions. It's designed to process and predict data effectively, leveraging advanced modeling techniques.

# File Descriptions
EDA.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook for initial data exploration and cleaning. It includes:

Data import and inspection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Merging of different datasets.
pipeline.py: This script is responsible for the data processing and machine learning pipeline. It includes:

Advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
Training of machine learning models, including ensemble methods.
Model evaluation and validation.
main.py: A FastAPI application for deploying the trained model. Features include:

Endpoints for model health check (/status) and version (/version).
A prediction endpoint (/predict) that takes input data and returns model predictions.
Installation
To set up the project, you will need Python and the necessary libraries. Install the requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt (ensure you create this file based on your project's dependencies).

# Running the API
To run the FastAPI server:

Navigate to the directory containing main.py.
Execute uvicorn main:app --reload. This will start the server on localhost at the default port (8000).
Usage
For EDA: Open EDA.ipynb in a Jupyter environment and run the cells to understand data patterns and preprocessing steps.
For the pipeline: Run pipeline.py to process data and train the model.
For predictions: Use the /predict endpoint of the FastAPI app, sending data in the required format.
